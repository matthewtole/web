# React Flow Components

This is a collection of useful components that you can easily integrate into your React Flow application. It utilizes the new [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli), which builds on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

## Prequisites

You need to have `shadcn` and `tailwind` configured in your project. This can be done automatically by running the follwing command in your project root directory. If you want to understand why we are building this on top of shadcn, head over to our [motivation](#motivation).

```bash copy
npx shadcn init
```

## Usage

Find a component you like and run the command to add it to your project.

```bash copy
npx shadcn add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name
```

- This command copies the component code inside your components folder. You can change this folder by adding an alias inside your `shadcn.config.js`.

- It automatically installs all necessary dependencies

- It utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks you if you'd like to overwrite them.

- It uses your existing tailwind configuration.
