# Motivation

We were pondering on how to make it easier for developers to build applications with React Flow for a long time. The most obvious thing was always to just **create a component library with a set of custom nodes and edges**.

This might sound great on paper but there are 2 major issues to this approach. First, looking at all the amazing and wildly different things being built with React Flow, there is no ultimate set of components that would satisfy everyone.
Second, having used UI libraries in the past ourselves, there was always a burden carried around: users being held back by limited features exposed by these libraries and developers playing catch-up with growing needs of their users.

These are incidentally some of the reasons headless UI libraries and ultimately solutions like _shadcn_ became more popular over the years.

Especially shadcn has caught our eyes in providing a solution for some major pain points.

1. **Ease of use**: Going from 0 to 80 by just running a single command.
2. **Compatibility**: Works with different setups and uses existing configuration.
3. **Extensibility**: You own the code right away. Need a new prop? Just add it.
