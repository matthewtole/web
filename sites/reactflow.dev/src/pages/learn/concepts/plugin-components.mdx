# Plugin Components

React Flow comes with several additional plugin components. In this guide we show you how to use them. We are using our [previous example code](/learn/concepts/core-concepts) here.

## MiniMap

If your flow gets bigger, you might want to get an overview quickly. For this we have built the [`MiniMap` component](/api-reference/components/minimap). You can easily add it to your flow by adding it as a children:

import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/mini-map/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/mini-map/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

## Controls

React Flow comes with a customizable controls bar, that you can use by importing the [`Controls` component](/api-reference/components/controls)

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/controls/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/controls/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

## Background

If you want to display the pattern background, you can use the [`Background` component](/api-reference/components/background)

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/background/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/background/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

## Panel

A helper component to display content on top of the React Flow viewport. [`Panel` component](/api-reference/components/panel)

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/panel/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/learn/panel/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>
