# New tutorial – Create a slide show presentation with React Flow

We recently published the findings from our React Flow 2023 end-of-year survey
with an [interactive presentation](/developer-survey-2023) of the key findings,
using React Flow itself. There were lots of useful bits built into this slideshow
app, so we wanted to share how we built it!

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/react/tutorials/presentation/app/source.json`}
  preview={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/react/tutorials/presentation/app/index.html`}
  framework="react"
  showEditor={false}
/>
