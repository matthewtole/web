# Layouting example for Entitree Flex

We add a new layouting algorithm to our example lineup with the addition of
Entitree Flex. This algorithm is similar to d3-hierarchy but allows for sibling
nodes as well as nodes with different dimensions.

This example was very kindly contributed by GitHub user [@kaustubhxd](https://github.com/kaustubhxd),
thanks Kaustubh! Check it out below.
