# New multi-connection line example!

Quite a while back, a user opened a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues/315)
asking us to add the ability to draw multiple connection lines to the library. We
don't have any plans to add this to the library itself, but we hope this example
helps folks who need this functionality in their own apps. Check it out
[here](/examples/edges/multi-connection-line).
