description: Use the `isConnectable` prop to limit the number of connections a handle can have

<ExampleLayout>
This is an example of a custom node with a custom handle that can limit the amount of connections a handle can have using the `isConnectable` prop.
You can use a boolean, a number (the number of max. connections the handle should have) or a callback function that returns a boolean
as an arg for the `isConnectable` prop of the CustomHandle component.

  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/nodes/connection-limit/index.html`}

/>
