<ExampleLayout>
This is an example implementation for floating edges. The source and target position of the edges are getting calculated dynamically. You can find the implementation details in the utils.js file.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/edges/floating-edges/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/edges/floating-edges/index.html`}
  framework="react"
