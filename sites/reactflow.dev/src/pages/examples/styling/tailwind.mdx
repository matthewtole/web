description: Use Tailwind CDN to easily make nice looking flows

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';
import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';
import { ExampleLayout } from 'xy-shared';

import { getStaticCode } from 'xy-shared/server';
export const getStaticProps = getStaticCode(['examples/styling/tailwind']);

<ExampleLayout>
In this example we are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the flow.

<Callout type="warning">
  We are using the Tailwind CDN for this example. Because of a [bug](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/issues/624)
  with SandPack, opening the sandbox below will not have the script added to the
  HTML document. To make sure the example works correctly, make sure you add
  `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` to the HTML document
  in `public/index.html` manually.

If you are copying the example locally, you will likely have Tailwind set up
differently, and can ignore this warning.
