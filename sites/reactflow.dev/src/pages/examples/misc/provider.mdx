<ExampleLayout>
If you are working with multiple flows on a page or if you are using a client side router you need to wrap each flow with a [`ReactFlowProvider`](/api-reference/react-flow-provider) so that every flow has its own store instance.
Using a `ReactFlowProvider` is also mandatory if you want to access the internal state outside of the `ReactFlow` component.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/misc/provider/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/misc/provider/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
