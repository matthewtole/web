title: Elkjs Tree
description: For a more powerful alternative to dagre, you can also use elkjs to layout your graphs

import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';

<ExampleLayout>
Like our [dagre example](/examples/layout/dagre), this example shows how you can integrate [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) with React Flow for more advanced tree layouts. The code for this example builds a similar tree to the dagre example, but you can look at the reference [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) to see what you can configure (hint: it's a lot).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/layout/elkjs/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/layout/elkjs/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
