# React Flow UI

This is a collection of useful components that you can easily integrate into your React Flow application. It utilizes the new [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli), which builds on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

## Prequisites

You need to have `shadcn` and `tailwind` configured in your project. This can be done automatically by running the follwing command in your project root directory. If you want to understand why we are building this on top of shadcn, skip to our [Motivation](#motivation).

```bash copy
npx shadcn init
```

## Usage

Find a component you like and run the command to add it to your project.

```bash copy
npx shadcn add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name
```

- This command copies the component code inside your components folder. You can change this folder by adding an alias inside your `shadcn.config.js`.

- It automatically installs all necessary dependencies

- It utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks you if you'd like to overwrite them.

- It uses your existing tailwind configuration.

## Motivation

We were pondering on how to make it easier for developers to build applications with React Flow for a long time. The most obvious thing was always to just **create a component library with a set of custom nodes and edges**.

This might sound great on paper but there are 2 major issues to this approach. First, looking at all the amazing and wildly different things being built with React Flow, there is no ultimate set of components that would satisfy everyone.
Second, having used UI libraries in the past ourselves, there was always a burden carried around: users being held back by limited features exposed by these libraries and developers playing catch-up with growing needs of their users.

These are incidentally some of the reasons headless UI libraries and ultimately solutions like _shadcn_ became more popular over the years.

Especially shadcn has caught our eyes in providing a solutoin for some major pain points.

1. **Ease of use**: Going from 0 to 80 by just running a single command.
2. **Compatibility**: Works with different setups and uses existing configuration.
3. **Extensibility**: You own the code right away. Need a new prop? Just add it.

Will this be the definite solution for React Flow UIâ„¢? Not sure yet, we are navigating in uncharted waters here.
