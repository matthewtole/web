<ExampleLayout>
Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular Svelte component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behaviour.

  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/nodes/custom-node/index.html`}
