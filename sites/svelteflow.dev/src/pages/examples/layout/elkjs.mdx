also use elkjs to layout your Svelte Flow graphs. "

<ExampleLayout>
Like our [dagre example](examples/layout/dagre), this example shows how you can integrate [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) with Svelte Flow for more advanced tree layouts. The code for this example builds a similar tree to the dagre example, but you can look at the reference [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) to see what you can configure (hint: it's a lot).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/layout/elkjs/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/layout/elkjs/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
  activeFile="Flow.svelte"
/>
</ExampleLayout>
